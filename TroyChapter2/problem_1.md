**1. A SHA is...**

<li>Simple Hash Algorithm: a snapshot of what the codebase looked like at the time of that commit. A unique identifier for the whole lifespan of the repository existing.</li>

<li>Git commands to bring content up and down from the Git system are $git add, $git commit, $git push, and $git pull. Git log is another command, which will display a list of recent commit messages. Git log-1 would give the most recent commit. Git log-2 would give the most recent two commits.</li>

**2. A branch is...**

<li>A name we can attach to a specific commit in our history. The command git branch is used to list all the branches.</li>

**3. A remote...**

<li>A decentralized version control system, like GitHub, which holds a master version but lets people have local versions for working and then merge updates into the server version. Does not auto-upload and save like consumer-friendly cloud storage; must be manually updated by a developer's commit with a message noting what the changes are.</li>

**4. The commands would be..**
git add .
git commit -m "Submit updates to feature_enhancement and bug_report docs, dependencies and issue templates."
git push origin main #push your local work up to the Main branch
git pull origin main #pull the latest changes from online down to your local workspace for your next session.
