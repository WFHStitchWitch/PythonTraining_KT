**1. You shouldn't...**
Run commands you found on the internet if you don't know the extend of what they do.
Run Git commands that use the -f flag because they are meant to brute force repository updates, and that will absolutely wreck your local work, the online repo work, or possibly both.

**2. I think...**
I have just discovered my latest notes on Problem 1 are only saved on my desktop and I didn't push them up to the online repository, so trying to work on Problem 1 on my tablet is a no-go. Working with consumer cloud services has me spoiled for auto-saves to the cloud and I had forgotten how annoying it is to be stuck somewhere else without your most recent version available.

You should commit, at the very minimum, each time you end a working session on a given device if you access your files on more than one device or workstation. VS Code allows for saving at intervals or when your tab goes out of focus, which I think is only making local autosave files that are temps. Ideally, follow the old Sibelius program advice and "if it makes you smile, save it." Alternatively, "if you can't remember the last time you committed, do it now."
