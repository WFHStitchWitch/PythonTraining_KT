'''
This module uses Python's "random" library. Line 1 imports it for use in this module. Line 2 defines a function named generate_random_numbers and gives it parameters. Lines 8-10 give the parameter variables some values to hold. Line 11 creates a variable named random_numbers that holds a call to the function generate_random_numbers. This was required or else nothing would print. The variable random_numbers started out as an empty list inside the definition of the generation function, but it wasn't accessible to the print function until later modifying that the variable random_numbers should call to that function and run it.'''
